The wavelengths in this spectrum range from around 400 to over 700 nanometers. Blue colors appear when these wavelengths have the highest intensity.\n\nLight with longer wavelengths (red) passes through air and enters the eye, while light with shorter wavelengths (blue) pass through the atmosphere and reach the surface of Earth. The blue light has a high density of energy, while red light has a lower density. When light reaches the surface, it interacts with matter in the atmosphere, causing some areas to be more reflective than others. This reflectance is proportional to the wavelength and intensity of the light: lighter colors will have higher reflectivity levels, as they have fewer scattering particles in their path.\n\nThe blue color we see in the sky is due to a combination of these reflections and scattering effects, resulting in a rainbow-like effect when seen from a distance. The exact wavelengths of light that cause this blue color are determined by the spectrum of sunlight, which depends on factors like temperature, cloud cover, and the composition of Earth's atmosphere.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,14606,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,2927,338,8581,491,3578,6819,1549,263,5412,10767,299,310,10742,2435,4141,9499,515,1422,5633,310,278,28118,11082,1212,293,18272,29892,2000,278,7962,18272,29889,450,10742,2435,4141,9499,297,445,18272,3464,515,2820,29871,29946,29900,29900,304,975,29871,29955,29900,29900,23432,8328,29879,29889,10924,11955,2615,746,1438,10742,2435,4141,9499,505,278,9939,26171,29889,13,13,23410,12443,29873,411,5520,10742,2435,4141,9499,313,1127,29897,14517,1549,4799,322,24395,278,10977,29892,1550,3578,411,20511,10742,2435,4141,9499,313,9539,29897,1209,1549,278,25005,322,6159,278,7101,310,11563,29889,450,7254,3578,756,263,1880,9027,310,5864,29892,1550,2654,3578,756,263,5224,9027,29889,1932,3578,22170,278,7101,29892,372,16254,29879,411,4383,297,278,25005,29892,10805,777,10161,304,367,901,9432,573,1135,4045,29889,910,9432,749,338,29839,304,278,10742,2435,4141,29882,322,26171,310,278,3578,29901,3578,261,11955,674,505,6133,9432,2068,11174,29892,408,896,505,28145,14801,292,17105,297,1009,2224,29889,13,13,1576,7254,2927,591,1074,297,278,14744,338,2861,304,263,10296,310,1438,17842,29879,322,14801,292,9545,29892,9819,297,263,17251,17729,29899,4561,2779,746,3595,515,263,5418,29889,450,2684,10742,2435,4141,9499,310,3578,393,4556,445,7254,2927,526,10087,491,278,18272,310,6575,4366,29892,607,7111,373,13879,763,10430,29892,9570,4612,29892,322,278,15259,310,11563,29915,29879,25005,29889],"total_duration":15912756846,"load_duration":776291998,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":1480412000,"eval_count":276,"eval_duration":13609238000}
